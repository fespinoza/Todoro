Just a todo list + pomodoro technique

An app that lets you list tasks and then use a timer in order to focus on each task at a time, using [the pomodoro technique][pomodoro]. Then the app keeps a log of the pomodoros ~~units of uninterrupted work~~ that you performed in this task.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

In simple words:

1. you work in a given task for 25 minutes (no interruptions, facebook, etc allowed)
2. you take a break after of 5 minutes.
3. ~~profit~~, repeat step 1, and every 4 pomodoros take a longer break.

If you want to learn more about it, check the [official page of the pomodoro tecnique][pomodoro].

## How do install this app?

Soon on the App Store.

Sooner on Test Flight.
